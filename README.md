# What is MTD?

MTD is a quick and simple tower defense game about blasting away you foes!

## Current Progress

Currently, we're in the _Planning_ phase, where we're planning out the game, it's functions, and how it will generally flow. We're also considering art styles, ui elements, and discussing the barebones elements of a Tower Defense game.
